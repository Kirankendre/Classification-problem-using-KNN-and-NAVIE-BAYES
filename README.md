# 1st Problem Statement :- 
Data for classifying patients based on two classes
Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients
About Data :-
The data have been organized in two different but related classification tasks.

column_3C_weka.csv (file with three class labels)

The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients).

column_2C_weka.csv (file with two class labels)

For the second task, the categories Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category labelled as 'abnormal'. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients).






# 2ND PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
About the data:-
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Input Features:- The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables

One target variable:- Outcome.

Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on
